# Contributing instructions

Thank you for considering making a contribution to this repository. In this file, you will find guidelines for contributing efficiently. If you are unsure whether this is the appropriate repository for a particular issue, please review the repository structure of this organisation.

Please do not file an issue to ask a question. You will get faster results by using the resources below.

Before proceeding, please review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Architecture

This section describes the project's architecture. Please read it thoroughly before contributing to the project.

## Environment

The project has been implemented in [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/). [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) is used for dependency management, allowing for a seamless installation of dependencies. To install the project locally, use the following command:

```sh
pipenv install --dev
```

## Repository structure

The root folder contains the following files:

- **config.json.example.** This file contains an example scheduler's configuration, and represents a template for the config.json file.
- **dangerfile.ts.** This file contains the Danger configuration.
- **package.json.** This file contains the dependencies for the Danger validation of the repository pull requests.
- **Pipfile.** This file contains the scheduler's dependencies.
- **Pipfile.lock.** This file contains the scheduler's dependencies, pinned at the latest compatible available version.
- **scheduler.py.** This file contains the main code of the scheduler.
- **scheduler_config.json.** This file contains the scheduler's configuration, such as the specification of which files should be checked for integrity, and must be overridden for each repository. 
- **yarn.lock.** This file contains the dependencies for the Danger validation of the repository pull requests, pinned at the latest compatible available version.

In addition, it contains the following folders:

- **ci.** This folder contains support utilities to run continuous integration checks.
- **helpers.** This folder contains support utilities to interact with the CircleCI API and perform common operations.

## Code style

To keep consistent quality standards, a script is provided to verify that the code of this repository follows our formatting and linting rules. The source code should be formatted using [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) and linted using [Mypy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/). To verify that your commits follow these rules, please run:

```sh
pipenv run black && pipenv run mypy
```

When a new pull request is opened, the CI checks for formatting and linting issues. Please solve them before we can proceed with the review.

# Gitflow

This repository adopts a branch management system inspired by [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). The main branches are as follows:

- **Master**. The _master branch_ contains the codebase that has reached the production environment. Commits are manually merged in this branch by project maintainers when a new build reaches the production environment.
- **Development**. The _development branch_ is where development takes place. This branch serves as an integration branch for features and fixes‚Äîit could be considered the unstable beta branch.

## Feature and fixes

When contributors wish to implement a new feature or a fix, they should branch from the development branch and open a pull request. Branches should have a meaningful name that adheres to the following convention:

```
<type>/name_of_feature_or_fix.
```

The _type_ prefix should be one of the following:

- **feature**. Used in the case that the branch implements a new feature.
- **fix**. Used in the case that the branch implements a fix.

Valid branch names are:

- _feature/additional\_checks_
- _fix/config_

Invalid branch names are:

- _feat/checks_
- _fix\_config_

## Releases

When the code is ready for a new release, a new release branch is cut from development. From the [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) website:

_Once development has acquired enough features for a release (or a predetermined release date is approaching), you fork a release branch off from development. Creating this branch starts the next release cycle, so no new features can be added after this point‚Äîonly bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks should go in this branch._

During this stage, the focus is on preparing the release by fixing issues. It is not possible to add new features to the codebase.

Once the release branch is stable, it is merged in both development and master.

# Commits

Please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) naming convention for consistency and to avoid problems with our continuous integration systems. The automatic systems also perform checks and mark as not ready for review any pull request that it determines has not followed the convention.

# How to contribute

When you encounter a bug or an issue with the system represented in this repository, you may choose to let the developers know the nature of the issue.

The Immuni project is composed of different repositories‚Äîone for each component or service. If you wish to raise something strictly relevant to this repository (i.e., a bug of the CI scheduler), please read on. However, to raise other issues or to highlight other bugs, please open an issue in the [Documentation repository](https://github.com/immuni-app/documentation). This lets everyone involved see it, consider it, and participate in the discussion, without slowing down the overall process.

## Issues

Before filing a new issue, please browse the relevant section and use the search functionality to check if it has already been filed by someone else.

- If this issue has previously been filed, please do not create a new one. Instead, add more information to the existing issue, or simply add the üëç symbol to the first message. This helps the project maintainers to identify issues and prioritise accordingly.
- If the issue has not already been filed, please create a new one.

### Creating a new issue

When creating a new issue, there are three categories:

- Bug report
- CI scheduler feature request
- General issue

Please ensure that you select the appropriate category for the issue. Each one has a unique template designed to elicit the information required to reproduce and fix the issue. If the issue does not fall under _Bug report_ or _CI scheduler feature request_, please select _General issue_. With a general issue, it is especially important to provide a significant amount of detail, to help the project maintainers and any other collaborators understand the issue clearly.

When an issue is opened, a triage label is automatically assigned. The project maintainers are automatically notified of the issue's creation‚Äîthey endeavour to address all issues as quickly as possible. When the issue has been triaged, a corresponding label will be assigned. Here is a list of [all the possible labels](#labels).

### Good first issues

If you are interested in contributing to Immuni but are unsure where to start, please search for issues with the Good first issue label. These issues are relatively easy tasks that can help you get familiar with the code.

## Pull requests

After opening an issue, you may want to help the developers further. If the issue has been triaged and if the project maintainers give the green light, you may propose a solution. Doing so is always appreciated. For this, please use the Pull Request tool.

Before proceeding, please ensure that your proposal relates to an issue that has already been reviewed.

The first step in opening a pull request is to fork the project. Please log in to your account, then select Fork in the repository's landing page. This allows you to work on a dedicated fork and push your changes there. Then, if you wish to apply these changes back in the main Immuni repository, create a pull request targeting this repository. For more detailed information, [please read this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

When creating a pull request, please choose a name that adheres to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) naming convention. It is important to review and follow this convention before creating a pull request. This ensures that the commit history remains clean and makes it easy to identify what each commit does.

After choosing the appropriate name, please use the following template for the body of the pull request:

```
